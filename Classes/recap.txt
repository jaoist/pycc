Classes
--
Creating classes allows a grouping of functions and attribute contained in 
a new object. Allows for multiple instances of the class that can exist in
differing states with a shared library of methods. 

Inheritance
--
Creating a class that takes another class as an argument is called creating a 
child class, or subclass. In Python 2.7 the super() method requires the
superclass and self as arguments.
